# Agent Usage Bar

Have you ever found yourself refreshing the Agent usage page, wondering how close you are to hitting your rate limit? Yeah, I've been there too. So I built this.

Now it's just a glimpse away — always sitting at the top of your screen.

## What it does

A tiny macOS menu bar app that shows your Claude Code and OpenAI Codex CLI usage at a glance. Click it for the full picture:

- Menu bar icon with a mini dual-bar showing 5-hour and 7-day utilization
- Detailed popover with per-window usage, per-model breakdown, and reset timers
- Extra usage tracking with USD currency display
- Usage history chart — see how your usage evolves over time (1h / 6h / 1d / 7d / 30d)
- Hover over the chart to see exact values at any point
- Configurable polling interval (5m / 15m / 30m / 1h)
- Built-in update checks via Sparkle
- Just sign in — OAuth via browser, no API keys to manage
- Minimal dependencies — SwiftUI, Swift Charts, Foundation, and Sparkle for updates

## Install

### Download

1. Download `AgentUsageBar.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Blimp-Labs/agent-usage-bar/releases/latest)
2. Open the disk image and drag `Agent Usage Bar.app` into `Applications`
3. Launch the app from `/Applications`
4. macOS may require right-click → **Open** on first launch

### Build from source

Requires Xcode 15+ / Swift 5.9+ and macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Blimp-Labs/agent-usage-bar.git
cd agent-usage-bar
make app            # build .app bundle
make dmg            # build drag-to-Applications disk image
make install        # copy to /Applications
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app — a menu bar icon appears
2. Click the icon → **Sign in with Claude** → authorize in your browser
3. Paste the code back into the app
4. The icon updates automatically (default: every 30 minutes)
5. Release builds show **Check for Updates…** in the popover so you can pull newer versions without re-downloading manually

Click the icon anytime to see:
- 5-hour and 7-day usage with progress bars and reset timers
- Per-model breakdown (Opus / Sonnet) when available
- Extra usage credits and limits
- Usage history chart with adjustable time range and hover details

## Data storage

All data is stored locally in `~/.config/agent-usage-bar/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `token` | OAuth access token (permissions: `0600`) |
| `history.json` | Usage history for the chart (30-day retention) |

History is buffered in memory and flushed to disk every 5 minutes and on app quit. No data is sent anywhere other than the Anthropic API.

On first launch after upgrading from Claude Usage Bar, the app migrates `~/.config/claude-usage-bar/` to `~/.config/agent-usage-bar/` when the new directory does not already exist.

## Development

```sh
make build          # release build only
make app            # build + create .app bundle
make zip            # build + bundle + zip + verify distribution artifact
make dmg            # build + bundle + DMG + verify distribution artifact
make release-artifacts  # build once, then create and verify both ZIP and DMG
make verify-release # inspect the packaged ZIP and DMG artifacts
make install        # build + install to /Applications
make clean          # remove build artifacts
```

## Publishing updates

This repo now uses a tag-driven release flow. Pushing a `v*` tag will:

- build the `.app` bundle once
- produce `AgentUsageBar.zip` for Sparkle and `AgentUsageBar.dmg` for manual installs
- verify the packaged artifacts contain the expected app bundle resources and updater framework
- create the GitHub Release
- reuse GitHub-generated release notes for both the GitHub Release and the Sparkle update entry
- generate a signed Sparkle `appcast.xml` from that exact zip
- deploy the appcast to GitHub Pages

Publishing a release is just:

```sh
git tag v0.0.5
git push origin v0.0.5
```

One-time repo setup:

1. Enable GitHub Pages and set the source to `GitHub Actions`.
2. Add a repository Actions secret named `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Local source builds intentionally ship with Sparkle disabled unless `SU_FEED_URL` is injected during packaging. This prevents forks and local builds from auto-updating to upstream binaries.

Manual installs should prefer the DMG. The ZIP remains the source of truth for Sparkle updates and appcast generation.

You can export the current Sparkle private key from your local Keychain with:

```sh
macos/.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/generate_keys --account agent-usage-bar -x /tmp/agent-usage-bar.sparkle.key
gh secret set SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY < /tmp/agent-usage-bar.sparkle.key
```

The appcast feed URL used by release builds is:

```text
https://blimp-labs.github.io/agent-usage-bar/appcast.xml
```

monitoring implementation — Anthropic OAuth flow, menu bar architecture,
SwiftUI views, and history charting — is their work.
